# Evan Bancroft

I write software and build performant, custom websites. I love learning new things and solving unique and complex problems.
My professional experience has focused on React and Elixir but I am eager to jump into lower-level programming as I have time and the opportunities present themselves.
I use Neovim btw, and when I'm not learning a new React framework I can be found tinkering on my homelab or spending time with my friends and family.
