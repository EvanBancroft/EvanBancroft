# Evan Bancroft

Hey, if you are really reading a random guy's readme on Github then you are either a recruiter or a stalker. Either way, welcome.

### A bit about me

I write software. I love learning new things and building out performant, complex systems. 
I use Neovim btw, and have most of my professional experience working on websites and enterprise web apps.
