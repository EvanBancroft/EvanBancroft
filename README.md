# Evan Bancroft

Hey, if you are really reading a random guy's readme on Github then you are either a recruiter or a stalker. Either way, welcome.

### A bit about me

I write software and I build performant and custom websites. I love learning new things and solving unique and complex problems.
My professional experience has focused on React and Elixir and I am eager to jump into lower-level programming as I have time and the opportunities present themselves.
I use Neovim btw, and when I'm not wanting to rewrite everything at my job I am building a homelab or spending time with my friends and family.
